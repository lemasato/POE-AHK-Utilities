## Compilation of small standalone tools I made for Path of Exile

### POE Borderless Enhanced [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lemasato/POE-AHK-Utilities/main/POE%20Borderless%20Enhanced.ahk)
#### What does it do?
- Play in borderless if you're experiencing the Vulkan fullscreen bug.  
- Play in borderless while keeping the taskbar visible.  
- Stretch the window for a widescreen-like game experience.  
- Can add black bars around the game window while playing in widescreen-like for a more enjoyable experience.  
 
#### How do I use it?
1. Install AutoHotKey  
https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe  
During installation, choose Unicode 64  
2. Set the variables here in the script according to your preferences  
Documentation for each is included in the scrit, read carefully  
3. Start the script  
4. Go in game and change your resolution to "Windowed"  
It can be "Windowed Fullscreen" but only if you don't experience the Vulkan bug where "Windowed Fullscreen" is actually working as normal exclusive "Fullscreen"  
5. Enjoy the magic
